<h1>Seeking Interactions</h1>
<h2><a href="https://flowingdata.com/2018/05/22/basketball-stat-cherry-picking/">Link to basketball visualization<a></h2>
<p>The page includes two different visualizations, both of which implement features
of interactive visualizations that Scott Murray discusses in <i>Interactive Data Visualization for
the Web</i>. Ten NBA players are featured. Switching from one to another, on either visualization, changes all of the graphs
and they transition in the way Murray discusses starting on page 158. The transition feature
can be employed in D3 with the code .transition(), allowing D3 to interpolate between old values and new values
and showing the in-between values rather than jumping immediately from one to another.</p>
<p>The graphs also employ a "hover to highlight" feature Murray demonstrates on page 197. 
Hovering over a bar in a graph changes the color of the bar from blue to black
to differentiate it from the others and provides more information about the statistic it is displaying. Similarly,
hovering over a square in the second visualization outlines the square with a thin black
outline and explains more information about the square. While
the graphs themselves allow the viewer to understand some trends, it is by hovering that 
information is truly portrayed. The hover feature only requires CSS; the label that appears
can be crafted using a "hidden div" in HTML along with CSS, according to Murray. A function is used to 
       procure each bar or square's x and y values and when these x and y values are hovered over, the div
       is displayed.</p>
